# Weather_Dashboard
This webapp takes in a users search for a location and gives the user back the weather for that day and the forecast for the next 5 days. 

# API 
The api used is the openWeather api and it gives back the longitude and latitude for the searched locations. 
The api also gives us the weather data we use in the day forecast and the week forecast.

# Issues with the site 
I was unable to get the previous searches data off the screen so the data stacks.
I was also unable to figure out the proper styling for the forecast boxes so one is out of place.
